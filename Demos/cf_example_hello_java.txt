Login syntax:
------
Use cf login to log in to PWS. The cf login command uses the following syntax to specify a target API endpoint, an org (organization), and a space: $ cf login [-a API_URL] [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] [-o ORG] [-s SPACE] .

API_URL: This is your API endpoint, api.run.pivotal.io.
USERNAME: Your username.
PASSWORD: Your password. Use of the -p option is discouraged as it may record your password in your shell history.
ORG: The org where you want to deploy your apps.
SPACE: The space in the org where you want to deploy your apps.

Java Hello world demo steps on cf CLI(Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)
Enter “cf login” to login. Enter your email id and password you used while registering to Pivotal Web Service.
Open Command Prompt and enter the command “CD <CF_FOLDER_PATH>”.

note : in case multiple spaces, you have to select your appropriate space.

2)
Enter the command “cf push” to publish the Hello World application.

Note: Apps names are global. Hence you may encounter the following error:
“The host is taken”.
To fix that, please add a suffix or prefix (or change the entire name) to the “host” attribute within the manifest.yml file.

Finally the application should be started and the app URL should be provided as below. For example in this case, it is sanjaydegaonkar.cfapps.io


Copy the URL (in this case sanjaydegaonkar.cfapps.io) and paste it in browser. You will see the application running.
